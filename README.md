# Uber Data Analysis using R

Uber is one of the largest transportation platforms in the world, with over 118 million users, 5 million drivers, and 6.3 billion trips annually, averaging 17.4 million trips daily. The key to Uber’s success lies in its ability to efficiently assign drivers to riders and leverage dynamic pricing to balance supply and demand.

This project dives into Uber’s data to uncover how data analysis drives these operations. With massive amounts of data collected every day, Uber relies heavily on advanced tools and machine learning frameworks for decision-making and ensuring positive experiences for both riders and drivers.

Through this project, I aim to explore and analyze Uber’s trip data to gain insights into rider behavior, trip patterns, and operational efficiencies. By working with this dataset, we can uncover trends and understand how companies like Uber use data to make informed decisions.

### Why Visualization Matters
Data storytelling is a critical aspect of machine learning and data science. It helps organizations understand complex data and derive actionable insights. Using visualizations, I aim to simplify intricate datasets into meaningful patterns that can help businesses make informed decisions.

This project primarily focuses on data visualization techniques using R, which serves as a foundation for developing insights and understanding customer behavior. The dataset spans trips recorded from **April 1, 2014**, to **September 30, 2014**, providing a rich context for exploration.

### Goals of the Project
- Analyze Uber data from April to September 2014.
- Build visualizations in R to uncover trends and patterns.
- Enhance my skills in data storytelling and visualization using the **ggplot2** library.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle. You can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirmotefaker/uber-dataset-from-april-to-september-2014).

## Key Packages Used in the Project

### ggplot2
This is the backbone of the project. **ggplot2** is one of the most popular data visualization libraries in R, widely used for creating intuitive and aesthetic plots.

### ggthemes
An extension to **ggplot2**, this package provides additional themes and scales that allow for more polished visualizations.

### lubridate
Since the dataset involves various time frames, **lubridate** helps categorize and manipulate time-related data for better analysis.

### dplyr
The go-to package for data manipulation in R. It allows for efficient data wrangling with a clear and readable syntax.

### tidyr
This package helps tidy the dataset, ensuring each variable gets its own column, each observation its own row, and each value its own cell. Clean data leads to clearer insights!

### DT
Using this package, I created interactive tables powered by the JavaScript library, **Datatables**, for better exploration of the data.

### scales
This package enhances graphical scales, providing well-placed axes and legends that automatically adapt to the dataset.
